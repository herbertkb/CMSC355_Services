Stricter handling of command line arguments.
	Test if file exists and throw errors.
	Print help message.
	
Fix Windows console output for non-Latin characters. 
	Currently it spits out gibberish to console, but prints to file correctly.
	From what I can tell, this is a deep problem with how Windows console 
	handles Unicode.
	
Re-implement Translate as GUI
	Besides being easier to use, this would also solve the 
	problem with screwy output to Windows console for non-Latin characters. 
	
Embed Translate as an applet into a web page.
	Party like it's 1999. 

More console output for Dictionary
	Option for logging output
	
ConcurrentMap for Dictionary to ease use by multiple clients.
